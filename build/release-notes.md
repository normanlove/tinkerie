<!-- release notes for 0.25.0-alpha: package.sh checks this line, so update the notes with every version -->
### New in {VERSION}
- **Makie cases make room for parts that stick out:** when a part hangs over the board edge (a microcontroller module's USB end, a USB-C socket, a button, an antenna), the generated case cuts a pocket in the wall for it, open at the top so the board still drops in, and the lid gets a filler that closes the slot above it. The case notes list each one and how far it sticks out. Works for board cases and keyboard cases.
